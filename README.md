# MetaImageMark

A framework to benchmark Image Processing Libraries.

## Features

## Application areas

The framework can be used for various tasks, including:

1. Image processing code optimization.
2. Performance comparison of various image processing libraries.
3. Investigation of the dependence of the speed of operations depending on the compilation parameters and/or hardware.

MetaImageMark has been successfully used to identify weaknesses of MinImg image processing library and its further
optimization.
