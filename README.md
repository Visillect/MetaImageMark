# MetaImageMark

A framework to benchmark Image Processing Libraries.

## Features

## Application areas

The framework can be used for various tasks, including:

1. Image processing code optimization.
2. Performance comparison of various image processing libraries.
3. Investigation of the dependence of the speed of operations depending on the compilation parameters.
4. Investigation of the dependence of the speed of operations depending on the hardware.

MetaImageMark has been successfully used to identify weaknesses of MinImg image processing library and its further
optimization.
